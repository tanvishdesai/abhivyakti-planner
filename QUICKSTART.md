## Combo Day Explained

A "Combo Day" means you can attend 2+ events on the same day:

```
Example:
Date: 14-Nov-2025

Event 1: The Blue Hour @ 7:15 PM (Gujarat University)
Event 2: Beatroot @ 8:30 PM (15 min away at Gujarat University)

✅ POSSIBLE COMBO (45 min between events, enough time to travel)
```

### How it Calculates:
- 📅 Same date
